## issues:
Issue: trying to get a response from the peer client, it kept failing verification due to echo from server.
resolution: add logic on server to stop messages echoing back to client that sent original message

&nbsp;	***Client tries to load user private \& public keys from file***

&nbsp;	Client generates/receives session key

&nbsp;	Client connects to server

&nbsp;		***server responds with servers public key***

user enters message

&nbsp;	client uses key to encrypt message

&nbsp;	Client creates HMAC of message

&nbsp;	***Client signs HMAC using user private key***

&nbsp;	***Client Encrypts message \& HMAC â€¦ using server public key***

&nbsp;	client send encrypted message and HMAC to server

&nbsp;		server receives message

&nbsp;		***Server decrypts message using server private key***

&nbsp;		Server logs message received from user

		***Server decrypts HMAC using users public key (authentication)***

		***serer generates new hmac for message***

&nbsp;		***If new hmac == received decrypted hmac***

		***re-encrypt hmac with server private key***

&nbsp;		Server sends message to all clients

&nbsp;		Server logs message forwarded to each client

&nbsp;	client receives message

&nbsp;	***client decrypts hmac using server public key***

&nbsp;	client generates new hmac

&nbsp;	client compares new hmac with received hmac

&nbsp;	if hmac match

&nbsp;	client decrypts message using session key

&nbsp;	client displays message
